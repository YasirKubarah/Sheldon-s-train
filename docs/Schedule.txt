The three steps
The project is to be realized in three steps.

 Skeleton
 Prototype
 Complete

The goal of the Skeleton version is to verify that object and dinamic models are making up the model of the task. The Skeleton is a program containing all the business objects that are going to take part in the final system. The interfaces of objects are defined only. At the beginning every method writes its name on the screen and calls the methods he needs to fulfil his service. In case calling of methods depend on condition, a question referring to the condition ought to be asked on the screen interactively so the program goes on the way the answer defines. Skeleton must also be able to help checking different scenarios and sequence diagrams.  For keeping the system simple, controlling of the screen should use characters only.

The goal of the Prototype program is to demonstrate that the program is ready, works correctly, fulfills all tasks. Prototype version is a whole program except of the detailed interface. Prototype is well planned, timing and handling of active objects is completed. All methods of the business objects contain the final algorithms - except of those concerned with appearence. Paying attention to the logic and structure of interface, to the fact how much it reflects and makes visible the functioning of the program is very important.

Complete version of program may differ from prototype only becasuse of the quality of user interface. At evaluation internal structure of realization is more stressed than exteriors.

 

Schedule - due to this three-part division - lists the tasks to be completed until the given deadlines.
In the following part: acknowledgements and informations due to every task, detailed.
